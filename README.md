# OpenCV
#  Detecting and counting smiles and their intensities 
This project counts the number of smiles and their intensities.
The system is controlled by a 4x4 keypad connected to a Raspberry Pi 3 Model B.  
Two LEDs are also connected to the R pi. One blinks while the video is playing and the other one blinks when a screenshot is taken.  
Information is then stored in a database.
